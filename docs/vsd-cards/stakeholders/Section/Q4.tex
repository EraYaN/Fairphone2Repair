The trusted distributor is a person who can be seen as a direct stakeholder at one point in time and as an indirect stakeholder at a different point in time. He will be a direct stakeholder when he is contributing to the company, for instance when he is helping customers or performing other tasks for Fairphone: 	

\begin{itemize}
	\item store parts/phones
	\item repair (delivery)
	\item admin on forum
	\item gather and return broken parts

\end{itemize}

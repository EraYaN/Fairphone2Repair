\section{What card(s) did you choose and why? Please repeat the assignment on the card(s)!}

The cards we chose are the ``One Person, Multiple Roles'' and ``Changing Hands'' from the Stakeholders Envisioning Criteria.
 They have been chosen because they are the most applicable to our design project.
 One person, Multiple Roles states that the same individual can interact with the same system from different perspectives.
 While Changing Hands is about the product being used by different owners throughout its life.
 

For One Person, Multiple Roles, the assignment is to sketch a description of an individual who at one point in time has the role of a direct stakeholder with the system and at another point in time is in the role of an indirect stakeholder.
 

The assignment for Changing Hands is to design a scenario for the product changing hands.
 Imagine a specific challenge an individual might face when wanting to shift ownership.
 What features might make this process smoother.

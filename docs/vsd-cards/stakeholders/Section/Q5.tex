\section{What possible implications for your case can you foresee, based on your outcomes, results or conclusions?}

Possible considered implications arise when a TD is caught stealing, is not sufficiently capable to provide the repairing service or keeps dodging help requests. In the report measures against these three issues are elaborated, and if not corrected or justified, they result in the renouncement of the TD title, the restitution of the given apparatus and hardware and depending on the gravity of the act legal persecution might be applicable.

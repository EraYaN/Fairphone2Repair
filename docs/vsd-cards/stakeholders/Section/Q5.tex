\section{What possible implications for your case can you foresee, based on your outcomes, results or conclusions?}

Possible considered implications arise when a TD is caught stealing or selling hardware or equipment provided by Fairphone, when he is not sufficiently capable to provide the repairing service (even though TD boot-camps are an option) or keeps dodging help requests without a credible or unverifiable justification. In the report measures against these three issues are elaborated, and if not corrected or justified, they result in the renouncement of the TD title, the restitution of the given apparatus and hardware and depending on the gravity of the act legal persecution might be applicable.

\section{What possible implications for your case can you foresee, based on your outcomes, results or conclusions?}

Possible considered implications arise when a TD is caught stealing, is not sufficiently capable to provide the repairing service or keeps dodging help requests. In the report measures against these three issues are elaborated, and if not corrected or justified, they result in the renouncement of the TD title, the restitution of the given apparatus and hardware and depending on the gravity of the act legal persecution might be applicable.

Most of the implications that we can foresee, based on our outcomes, results and conclusions have to do with the TD's. Our TD could for instance turn out to be not as loyal as we expected and he might try to steal or sell phones, parts or other equipment that he is provided with. It is also possible that the trusted distributor turns out to be unable to perform all the services that he is asked to perform, while he stated that he would be able to. But these implications are very unlikely to happen and even if they happen they will quickly be resolved.

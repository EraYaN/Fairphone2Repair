\section{Describe the case (or design project) you are working on in this practicum}
Fairphone has given the task to find a way to make the customer service a pleasant experience for the client.
This is very important because in many cases the costumer requires service after a bad experience with the product, for instance, breaking a component.
This is the starting point of the journey.
Right after the client has broken his phone, it should be possible for him to quickly and painlessly change the broken part in a reasonable amount of time.


In order to make this happen a system of referred to as Trusted Distributors (TDs) has been developed.
They are Fairphone costumers willing to help make a difference.
They do this in their free time and free of charge.
They are however rewarded in a different manner, for instance with discounts.
A more elaborate description of their function can be found in the report \cite{ExploreLab}.

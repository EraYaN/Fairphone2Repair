\chapter{Trusted Distributors} %TODO Vincent Wouter Lian
\label{ch:trusted-distributors}
As a part of the distribution system, the inclusion of the costumers in the process was the most preferred option as a result of the brainstorm in section \ref{ch:initial-research}. This section describes how this is made possible.

Taking Simon from chapter \ref{ch:breaking-experience} into consideration, he would like to contribute to Fairphones' good doing by being the bridge between the costumer and the company. His function will involve two aspects: Providing hardware to costumers and provide the service, if necessary, to install it. First of, he has to be selected to be come a Trusted Distributor (TD).

\section{Becoming a Trusted Distributor}
Considering costumers would figuratively become the bridge between the costumer and the company, they need first of all, to be reliable and loyal. One of the possible ways to get selected, is by being a helpful member on the Fairphone forums, prepared to help people and having a high activity. This would result into being asked by the company to fill that position. An other way could be through application. Just as you would for a normal job. 

Of course not everyone can become a TD. This function should be special, since a TD is provided with a repair kit, which includes two complete dissembled phones, with instructions on how to take them apart and put them back together. The amount of TDs per city is defined by the amount of Fairphone owners in that city. The more people own a phone, the more TDs are required to meet the supply/demand requirements. This is determined through the Fairphone mobile registration which takes place when the product is purchased. On the registration, the motivation for the question will be stated, for example: ``\textit{Fairphone requires this information in order to help you through the Trusted Distributor network.}''  

%A percentage of FairPhone owners in a certain city (determined by initial phone registration). Since its mainly Europe, if someone has FairPhone over seas, direct shipping.

%Consumer can DIY, if not, Trusted Dealer can replace the broken hardware for virtual reward (or compensation decided by Dealer and Consumer, but this not up to FairPhone)

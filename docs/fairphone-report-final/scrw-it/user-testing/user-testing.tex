	The desire of the user testing to acquire a better understanding of the impulse use of the designed product. This is to gather information of user behaviour and refine the intuitive actions that the product causes. Test scenarios will be created in which the tester will have to use the currently designed product (V1.0 â€“ VX) in a range of tasks that will test the visual, interface and structural design of the card. These results will be recorded and compared.

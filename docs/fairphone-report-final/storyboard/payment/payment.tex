	\section{Payment}\label{sec:storyboard-payment}
	The payment is performed through the application. After ordering the new component, it will be sent to a TD. The TD's information will be stored and he will be registered as current holder of the unpaid part (section \ref{sec:td-regulations}). 
	
	The fee will be charged to the owner of the phone with which ever payment method they prefer. They will redirect to a payment page, iDeal or Credit Card for instance. What needs to be noted, is that there will be different payment protocols since there are different ways a component can be delivered to he customer. For this, a payment flowchart has been made (Figure \ref{fig:PaymentFlowChart})

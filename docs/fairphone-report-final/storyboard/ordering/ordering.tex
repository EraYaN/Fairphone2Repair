	\section{Diagnosing and ordering}
	\label{sec:storyboard-diagnosing}
	The first thing that occurs as soon as there is a problem with the phone, is starting the repair process through an built-in application. The application is an idea which hasn't been taken forward, and more information can be found in chapter \ref{ch:diagnostic-application}. 
	
	Diagnosing the problem is a very important part of the process since this is the first experience the customer will have with the repairing system. Also, it is important to keep in mind that the customer is about to receive bad news about their product, thus, they won't like receiving the notification.
	
	At this point in time, all three persona's undergo the same process. Once a connection with a TD is established, and the component has been ordered (section \ref{sec:td-repairing}) through the application, that is where they choose the path they most prefer.
